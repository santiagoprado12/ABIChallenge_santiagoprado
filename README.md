# Titanic end to end MLops project 🚢

## Introduction 

This project provides a machine learning-powered API designed to predict passenger survival probabilities on the Titanic dataset. Built using FastAPI, it includes both individual and batch prediction endpoints that leverage a pre-trained model for inference. The API is integrated with a PostgreSQL database for logging predictions, while a streamlined machine learning pipeline manages model training, validation, and feature selection. Additionally, a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit enables easy access for manual and batch predictions.


## Key Features 🗝️

- **FastAPI-Powered Endpoints:** Provides two main endpoints:

  - **/v1/prediction:** For single passenger survival predictions.
  - **/v1/batch_prediction:** For batch survival predictions.
- **ML Pipeline for Model Training:** Comprehensive machine learning pipeline includes:

- **Data preprocessing and feature engineering.**
  - Model training and hyperparameter tuning with options for multiple algorithms.
  - Automated feature selection using permutation importance.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes PostgreSQL to log input data and predictions, ensuring traceability and data management.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit, this interface supports manual input and batch prediction through CSV uploads, allowing for easy testing and usage.

- **Modular CLI Commands:** Command-line commands to manage training, validation, and testing with code coverage, enabling seamless model lifecycle management.

## CLI Overview 💻

The project includes a command-line interface (CLI) built with Typer, allowing efficient management of model training, validation, testing, and SQL command execution. The CLI commands are defined in `src/cli/main.py` and provide the following options:

- **`train`**: Trains one or more specified models, with an optional accuracy threshold for model registration.
  - **Arguments**:
    - `-m`, `--model`: Specify one or more models to train (e.g., "random_forest", "gradient_boosting").
    - `-th`, `--acc-threshold`: Set an accuracy threshold (between 0 and 1). Models meeting this threshold are saved for deployment.

- **`validation`**: Validates the performance of the best model on a validation dataset. Optionally, retrains the model if it doesn't meet a specified accuracy threshold.
  - **Arguments**:
    - `-th`, `--acc-threshold`: Accuracy threshold for model retraining. If the current model score is below this threshold, a new model is trained.

- **`test`**: Runs the test suite with optional coverage reporting.
  - **Arguments**:
    - `-c`, `--coverage`: Flag to include code coverage reporting in the test results.

- **`run-sql`**: Executes a specified SQL file against the PostgreSQL database, retrieving results if applicable.
  - **Arguments**:
    - `sql_file`: Path to the SQL file to be executed.

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Train specified models with a minimum accuracy threshold
python -m src.cli.main train --model=knn --model=random_forest --model=gradient_boosting -th=0.7
```
```bash
# Validate the model with a minimum accuracy threshold of 0.75
python -m src.cli.main validation --acc-threshold 0.75
```

```bash
# Run tests with code coverage
python -m src.cli.main test --coverage
```

```bash
# Execute a SQL file against the PostgreSQL database
python -m src.cli.main run-sql --sql-file "src/db/queries/select_all_api_table.sql"
```

## Devcontainer Setup 🚀

The project includes a `.devcontainer` setup for development in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The container is pre-configured with all the necessary extensions and environment variables to simplify development.

### To use the Devcontainer:

1. Open the project in VSCode.
2. When prompted, reopen the project in the Devcontainer.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to connect to the PostgreSQL database. They should be stored in the `.env` file in the root directory: (ask for the credentials)

```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=
POSTGRES_DB=
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_PORT=
```


## Challenge development 💪


This section outlines the solution of the challenge, including the architecture, collaboration workflow, automation processes, and deploying the ML model as an API.

### Architecture
  
The proposed architecture:

![Workflow](images/arquitecture.png)


A MVP was deployed using a simpler architecture:

API - https://9k6yjdcqae.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/ <br />
UI - http://load-balancer-ui-2016319480.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ (only reachable using pc web browser)

### ML Model Deployment Locally

- **API Development**: The API was developed using the FastAPI framework. You can find the code [here](src/api/). To deploy the API, use the provided [Dockerfile](API-Dockerfile). The api has 2 endpoints:
  - **/v1/prediction:** For single passenger survival predictions.
  - **/v1/batch_prediction:** For batch survival predictions.
  
- **UI Development**: The UI was developed with the Streamlit framework. The code is available [here](src/front), and deployment is handled by a [Dockerfile](UI-Dockerfile). The UI supports two types of predictions:
  - **Unique**: Perform a single prediction using the graphical interface and text fields.
  - **Batch**: Perform batch predictions using a CSV file. Try it out with this [example file](data/api-test.csv).
  
- **Estimations Storage**: Predictions and incoming data are stored in a PostgreSQL database. The database is deployed on RDS. You’ll need credentials saved in a `.env` file to access it.

- **Testing**: The codebase includes various tests to ensure the correct behavior of each module.

To run the full solution locally, execute:

```bash
# Ensure your .env file is set up
docker-compose up
```
However, both the UI and API are deployed online, and you can access them here:

API - https://9k6yjdcqae.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/ <br />
UI - http://load-balancer-ui-2016319480.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ (only reachable using pc)
